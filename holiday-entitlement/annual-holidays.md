# Annual holidays

Leaf offer 20 days of paid vacation, along with the standard national holidays, every year.

We don't allow for your allowance to be carried forward, and no payment in lieu will be made in respect of untaken holidays other than in the event of termination of your employment.

To request holiday, email Chris or Mike, who will review the request.

Holiday dates will normally be allocated on a 'first come, first served' basis whilst ensuring that operational efficiency and appropriate staffing levels are maintained throughout the year. You should give at least four weeks notice of your intention to take holidays and two weeks notice is required for single days.

We collectively down-tools over the Christmas/New Year period, and it's your responsibility to reserve sufficient days from your annual entitlement to cover the period. If you have not accrued sufficient holiday entitlement, you will be given unpaid leave of absence.
