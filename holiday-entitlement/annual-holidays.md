# Annual holidays

1. Your annual holiday entitlement is shown in your individual Statement of Main Terms of Employment (Form SMT).
2. It is our policy to encourage you to take all of your holiday entitlement in the current holiday year. We do not permit holidays to be carried forward and no payment in lieu will be made in respect of untaken holidays other than in the event of termination of your employment.
3. You must complete the online booking system for all holiday requests and have it signed off by your Line Manager before you make any firm holiday arrangements.
4. Holiday dates will normally be allocated on a "first come - first served" basis whilst ensuring that operational efficiency and appropriate staffing levels are maintained throughout the year.
5. You should give at least four weeks notice of your intention to take holidays and two weeks notice is required for odd single days.
6. You may not normally take more than two working weeks consecutively.
7. Your holiday pay will be at your normal basic pay unless shown otherwise on your Statement of Main Terms.
8. You are required to reserve sufficient days from your annual entitlement to cover the Christmas/New Year shut-down period. If you have not accrued sufficient holiday entitlement to cover this period you will be given unpaid leave of absence.
