# Introduction

1. It is necessary to have a minimum number of rules in the interests of the whole organisation.
2. The rules set standards of performance and behaviour whilst the procedures are designed to help promote fairness and order in the treatment of individuals. It is our aim that the rules and procedures should emphasise and encourage improvement in the conduct of individuals, where they are failing to meet the required standards, and not be seen merely as a means of punishment. We reserve the right to amend these rules and procedures where appropriate.
3. Every effort will be made to ensure that any action taken under this procedure is fair, with you being given the opportunity to state your case and appeal against any decision that you consider to be unjust.
4. The following rules and procedures should ensure that the correct procedure is used when requiring you to attend a disciplinary hearing;
- you are fully aware of the standards of performance, action and behaviour required of you;
- disciplinary action, where necessary, is taken speedily and in a fair, uniform and consistent manner;
- you will only be disciplined after careful investigation of the facts and the opportunity to present your side of the case. On some occasions temporary suspension on contractual pay may be necessary in order that an uninterrupted investigation can take place. This must not be regarded as disciplinary action or a penalty of any kind;
- other than for an "off the record" informal reprimand, you have the right to be accompanied by a fellow employee at all stages of the formal disciplinary process;
- you will not normally be dismissed for a first breach of discipline, except in the case of gross misconduct; and
- if you are disciplined, you will receive an explanation of the penalty imposed and you will have the right to appeal against the finding and the penalty.
