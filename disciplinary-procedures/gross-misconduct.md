# Gross misconduct

Occurrences of gross misconduct are very rare because the penalty is dismissal without notice and without any previous warning being issued. It is not possible to provide an exhaustive list of examples of gross misconduct. However, any behaviour or negligence resulting in a fundamental breach of contractual terms that irrevocably destroys the trust and confidence necessary to continue the employment relationship will constitute gross misconduct. Examples of offences that will normally be deemed as gross misconduct include serious instances of:-
- theft or fraud;
- physical violence or bullying;
- deliberate damage to property;
- deliberate acts of unlawful discrimination or harassment;
- possession, or being under the influence, of illegal drugs at work;
- breach of health and safety rules that endangers the lives of, or may cause serious injury to, employees or any other person.

The above examples are illustrative and do not form an exhaustive list.
