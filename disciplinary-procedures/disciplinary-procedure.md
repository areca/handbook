# Disciplinary procedure
Disciplinary action taken against you will be based on the following procedure:-

## Unsatisfactory conduct
1. First offence: Formal verbal warning
2. Second offence: Written warning
3. Third offence: Final written warning
4. Fourth offence: Dismissal

## Misconduct
1. First offence: Written warning
2. Second offence: Final written warning
3. Third offence: Dismissal

## Serious misconduct
1. First offence: Final written warning
2. Second offence: Dismissal

## Gross misconduct

We retain discretion in respect of the disciplinary procedures to take account of your length of service and to vary the procedures accordingly. If you have a short amount of service you may not be in receipt of any warnings before dismissal but you will retain the right to a disciplinary hearing and you will have the right of appeal.

If a disciplinary penalty is imposed it will be in line with the procedure outlined above, which may encompass a formal verbal warning, written warning, final written warning, or dismissal, and full details will be given to you.

In all cases warnings will be issued for misconduct, irrespective of the precise matters concerned, and any further breach of the rules in relation to similar or entirely independent matters of misconduct will be treated as further disciplinary matters and allow the continuation of the disciplinary process through to dismissal if the warnings are not heeded.
