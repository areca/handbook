# Time Tracking

## How we track time

We use [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com/) to track our billable activity at work.

## Why we track time

Since we rarely take on fixed-cost work, we typically issue a monthly invoice to our clients. It's not uncommon for clients to request a breakdown of where these hours have gone along with their invoice. Tracking what we spend our time on is an easy way for us to provide this.

Tracking time also helps us when it comes to our end of year financial statements, as some of our activity is tax-deductible to a certain extent. Having these records makes the process of claiming this tax back much easier.

Keep in mind, we *do not expect employees to log exactly 37.5 hours of time in Harvest every week*. We understand that the actual amount of work you get done week to week varies, and that there are other parts of your job that take time from your working day.

## Good time tracking

- Use Harvest to create a new entry for each new activity you need to track. E.g. a meeting or call would be tracked as a separate item from development. 
- Use good descriptions that will make sense to both us and a client E.g. "Writing automated tests for the new referrals feature" instead of "Tests"
- Don't get neurotic about starting and stopping your timer, but do stop it if you're not going to be working on something for more than 5 minutes.
- Remember, you can retroactively edit your time entries and descriptions with Harvest. So if something's incorrect please don't be afraid to change it.
