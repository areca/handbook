# Internal communications

## How we communicate

Aside from the spoken word, which is our preferred method, we use [Slack](https://slack.com/) to keep the team connected.

## The importance of talking

As a remote company, it's incredibly important that our internal communications are as efficiently executed as possible. 

Keeping the team updated with your progress creates a shared understanding of what's being worked on, what's coming up, and where anyone is struggling. This ensured others aren't duplicating work, have visibility of what everyone is doing, and are able to step in if assistance is needed. 

## Good Slack habits

### Use the right channel

We tend to a new create channel for each client, and have distinct channels for specialisms; for example, _#design_ or _#development_. These are supplemented with a handful of more generic channels, including the ultimate catch-all _#general_.

While it can be tempted to continue a conversation in a single channel, it's important that topics are discussed in the correct place. Doing to reduces the noise in each channel, and makes retrieving conversations further down the line that much easier.

If a channel is needed, but does not yet exist, feel free to create a new one.

### Format appropriately 

Slack provides a handful of formatting tools that not only improve readability, but in some cases, make them easier to find later on. 

#### Code snippets

To display a portion of text as code, surround your text with single `backticks`. To create a multiline block of code, wrap your text in ```triple backticks```.

#### Blockquotes

Add an angle bracket (>) at the beginning of your message to highlight a single paragraph, or use three (>>>) to blockquote multiple paragraphs.

#### Posts

Posts are great for sharing a few paragraphs, and are often used to internally to sanity check important emails before they go out. Posts also support Markdown, which makes us extra happy.

### Notify only those that need to listen

A big part of being efficient in your online communications is notifying everyone that needs to know, and nobody that doesn't. 

Along with making sure messages are in the correct channel, Slack provides a number of commands, including @everyone, @channel, and @here, that call the attention of team members in a conversation.

### Employ good housekeeping

As Leaf begin new work with clients, new channels will be created, and as a result, you'll often find yourself invited to more and more Slacks channels

It stands to reason that the more channels you're part of, the more messages you'll receive. It's important to maintain your focus by leaving channels you no longer need to be part of.
