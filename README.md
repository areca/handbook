# Handbook
Welcome to the Leaf Employee Handbook. These guidelines are designed to not only introduce you to our organisation, but to act as a reference throughout your employment.

While it's not the most exciting of tasks, we ask that you study the Handbook upon joining Leaf. In addition to setting out our policies, it also contains information on some of the main employee benefits that may be available to you. If you're unsure of anything in the handbook, please ask Mike or Chris, and they'll be happy to provide clarification.

As the organisation grows, we'll make occasional amendments to the Handbook.
