# Self-certification absence

Following any period of sickness, you should complete a sickness form on your return to work. The form can be requested from Mike Carter or Chris Annetts.

If you are returning to work after a period of sickness of more than 7 calendar days a medical certificate or certificates should already have been provided to cover the period of absence in excess of these first seven days.
