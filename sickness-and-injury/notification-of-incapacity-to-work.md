# Notification of incapacity to work

As soon as you're aware that you'll be unable to work, let the team know on Slack at the earliest possible opportunity.

If your incapacity extends to more than seven calendar days you are required to notify us of your continued incapacity once a week thereafter, unless otherwise agreed.
