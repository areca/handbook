# Progress updates

## Why progress updates
As a growing remote software development company, it's becoming common for those responsible for managing a client to not have direct involvement on the project's development. Progress updates help to keep everyone who needs to be involved in the loop enough so they can:

 - Communicate updates back to the client
 - Deal with out of the blue questions from the client
 - Manage developer workloads
 - Manage their own workloads
 - Issue invoices at appropriate times
 - Be able to reassign or continue work in case of sickness or injury

## When to give a progress update
Progress updates aren't always necessary, especially if you feel that the account manager is fully aware of what's happening. 

As a general rule though, if the account manager isn't directly involved in development, and progress has been made on a project on a particular day, we aim to give a short progress update be given at the end of the day.

## How to give a progress update
Progress updates are typically best given via Basecamp's "Check-ins" feature. If a project isn't managed in Basecamp, an email will do.

The progress update should cover:

 - What's changed
 - Any blockers you've encountered
 - Any worries you have about the work (including over timelines & estimates)
 - Any questions you have
 - Any relevant links/screenshots or other useful info
 - Your next steps
 
The progress update shouldn't involve a lot of writing, and doesn't need to be especially formal. The goal is to build up a clear log of progress in a few sentences, rather than waste time writing loads every afternoon.
