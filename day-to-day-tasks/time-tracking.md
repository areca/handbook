# Time Tracking

## How we track time

We use [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com/) to track our billable activity at work.

## Why we track time

Since we rarely take on fixed-cost work, we typically issue a monthly invoice to our clients. It's not uncommon for clients to request a breakdown of where these hours have gone along with their invoice. Tracking what we spend our time on is an easy way for us to provide this.

Tracking time also helps us when it comes to our end of year financial statements, as some of our activity is tax-deductible to a certain extent. Having these records makes the process of claiming this tax back much easier.

Keep in mind, we *do not expect employees to log exactly 37.5 hours of time in Harvest every week*. We understand that the actual amount of work you get done week to week varies, and that there are other parts of your job that take time from your working day.

## Good time tracking

### Track specific tasks

Harvest allows you to enter muiltiple tasks in a single day, and it's good practice to track these tasks individually. Use Harvest to create a new entry for each new activity you need to track; for example, a client meeting or conference call would be tracked as a separate item from development on their application. 

If you can't find the client, project, or task you need to track, raise it with Chris or Mike, and they'll amend Harvest.

### Add a description

Harvest provides a mechanism for adding descriptions to an entry via the _Add notes_ field. Use good descriptions that will make sense to both us and a client; for example, _"Writing automated tests for the new referrals feature"_, rather than _"Tests"_.

### Stop and start your timer as needed

The day is full of distractions, and sometimes you'll be stopped in your tracks while a timer is running. If you're not going to be working on something for more than a couple of minutes, simply pause your timer, and start it again when you're ready to pick the task back up.

### We all make mistakes

From time to time, you'll either forget to start a timer, or you'll leave one running at the end of the working day. If either of these happen, you can retroactively edit your time entries and descriptions with Harvest. If something's gone wrong, don't be afraid to change it; just do your best in estimating the correct entry.
