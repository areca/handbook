# Monitoring

We will maintain and review the employment records of all employees in order to monitor the progress of this policy.

Monitoring may involve:-
1. the collection and classification of information regarding the race in terms of ethnic/national origin and sex of all applicants and current employees;
2. the examination by ethnic/national origin and sex of the distribution of employees and the success rate of the applicants; and
3. recording recruitment, training and promotional records of all employees, the decisions reached and the reason for those decisions.

The results of any monitoring procedure will be reviewed at regular intervals to assess the effectiveness of the implementation of this policy. Consideration will be given, if necessary, to adjusting this policy to afford greater equality of opportunities to all applicants and staff.
