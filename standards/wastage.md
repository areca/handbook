# Wastage

1. We maintain a policy of "minimum waste" which is essential to the cost-effective and efficient running of our organisation.
2. You are able to promote this policy by taking extra care during your normal duties by avoiding unnecessary or extravagant use of services, time, energy, etc. The following points are illustrations of this:
	1. handle machines, equipment and stock with care;
	2. turn off any unnecessary lighting and heating. Keep doors closed whenever possible;
	3. ask for other work if your job has come to a standstill; and
	4. start with the minimum of delay after arriving for work and after breaks.
3. The following provision is an express written term of your contract of employment:-
	1. any damage to vehicles, stock or property (including non-statutory safety equipment) that is the result of your carelessness, negligence or deliberate vandalism will render you liable to pay the full or part of the cost of repair or replacement;
	2. any loss to us that is the result of your failure to observe rules, procedures or instruction, or is as a result of your negligent behaviour or your unsatisfactory standards of work will render you liable to reimburse to us the full or part of the cost of the loss; and
	3. in the event of an at fault accident whilst driving one of our vehicles you may be required to pay the cost of the insurance excess.
4. In the event of failure to pay, we have the contractual right to deduct such costs from your pay.
