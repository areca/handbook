# Other employment

You are expected to devote the whole of your time and attention during working hours to our business. If you propose taking up employment with an employer or pursuing separate business interests or any similar venture, you must discuss the proposal with your immediate Manager in order to establish the likely impact of these activities on both yourself and the Company. You will be asked to give full details of the proposal and consideration will be given to:
- Working hours;
- Competition, reputation and credibility;
- Conflict of Interest;
- Health, safety and welfare.

You will be notified in writing of the Companyâ€™s decision. The Company may refuse to consent to your request. If you work without consent this could result in the termination of your employment.

If you are unhappy with the decision you may appeal using the Grievance Procedure.
