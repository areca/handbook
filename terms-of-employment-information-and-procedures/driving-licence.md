# Driving licence

If it is a requirement of your job duties that you possess a current driving licence, the loss of such a licence as a result of a motoring conviction or on health grounds, may, if we are unable to provide suitable alternative employment, lead to the termination of your employment. You are required, wherever requested, to produce your driving licence for our inspection at any time when so requested.
