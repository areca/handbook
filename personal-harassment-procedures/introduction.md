# Introduction

Personal harassment can take many forms, from tasteless jokes to physical abuse. However it comes, we take it incredibly seriously, and it is totally unacceptable.

We take pride in the team bond we've fostered, and anything that detracts from a fun, safe working environment will be dealt with firmly.
