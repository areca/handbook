# Stakeholder pensions

We operate a stakeholder pension scheme that enables you to save for your retirement using your own money, together with tax relief and investment returns. You can build up a pension fund which you may use to buy an annuity when you are older or retire. The scheme is operated separately to any other pension provision and it is at your discretion and risk whether or not you contribute. Details are available from Chris or Mike
