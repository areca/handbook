# Administration

## Payment
The pay month is the calendar month, and basic salaries are paid by the last working day of the current month.

You will receive a payslip showing how the total amount of your pay has been calculated. It will also show the deductions that have been made and the reasons for them (e.g. Income Tax, National Insurance, etc).

Any pay queries that you may have should be raised with Chris or Mike.

## Overpayments
Mistakes happen, and if you are overpaid for any reason, the total amount of the overpayment will normally be deducted from your next monthly payment. If, however, this route would cause hardship, arrangements may be made for the overpayment to be recovered over a longer period.
