# Probation period

If you end up joining our little company, you'll initially start on a probationary period of three months.

The probationary period gives both parties a chance to see whether or not we're a good fit for each other; it's better to discover we're not a match on our third date, rather than when we're walking down the isle together.

During this period, both parties have the right to end the arrangement, which if triggered, would end with the employee being paid for work undertaken up to that point.
