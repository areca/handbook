# Mobility

First and foremost, we're a remote organisation; your primary work place is likely to be a home studio, a local co-working space, or maybe just living room sofa. 

From time-to-time, we may ask that you base yourself in Canterbury for the day; working in the same physical space comes with its own benefits, and it's good to see each other face-to-face every now and again. Another possibility is that we ask you to temporarily base yourself at a client's workplace; this could be periodically (e.g. once a week), or it may be for a burst of days during a project.

We'll always consult you in advance of any such arrangements, and will do our best to give you as much notice as possible.
