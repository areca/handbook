# Performance Reviews

## What is a performance review?
Performance reviews are an opportunity for us to **collectively** take a look at your past, and your future, with Leaf. They're a 6-monthly meeting in which we collectively talk about what you've been doing, where we collectively think your **strengths** lie and where we collectively think your **development opportunities** are.

## Your plan
The outcome of your performance review should be joint agreement on a plan for the next 6 months for your own personal development, that aligns with where Leaf is headed as a business. This plan is comprised of a few (typically 1 to 4) **6-month goals**, which can either be building upon a strength, improving on a development opportunity, or even introducing something completely new.

Your 6-month goals should be:

- **Aligned** - To your personal development interests, and Leaf's interests as a business. 
- **Achievable** - Within 6 months, or before your next review. Don't take on too much.
- **Measureable** - Either tangibly or anecdotally. Either way there should be evidence to support your achievement at your next review.

This all sounds very serious, but don't worry, it's very much your plan. If a goal doesn't work out for you, we can just talk through the reasons why at your next review and course-correct from there.

## The format
The performance review is always a face-to-face meeting, and will be with your manager; either Chris or Mike. In the meeting, you and your manager should come prepared with answers to the following questions:

### How have the past 6 months been generally?
How are you feeling about yourself and your work? Have things been easy or hard? Have you learned a lot or not? Are there any non-work related issues you'd like to discuss? 

### What have I been doing?
Just some brief headlines on things you've been working on, more detailed than just a list of client or project names, but doesn't need to detail every little change. If you had some goals set in your previous review, how have you progressed on against those? These just provide some reference points for discussion.

### What's been good?
What have you enjoyed about your job? This could be anything.

### What could have been better?
What aspects of your job haven't you enjoyed so much. Again, it could be anything.

### Where do my strengths lie?
What do you think you're doing well, either through hard work and focus or natural ability. This could be anything, but please come prepared to provide examples. 

### What are my development opportunities?
Where do you think you could develop yourself professionally to improve your skillset and performance? Again, this could be anything.

Lastly, you may also want to consider some ideas for goals, although these will be worked on properly together with your manager during the meeting.
