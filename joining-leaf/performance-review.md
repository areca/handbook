# Performance review

Every six months, you'll have a performance review, where we look to highlight where you've done well, surface any areas where you've struggled, and provide a platform for you to voice to any concerns. 

The better your perform in your role, the more we gain as an organisation; it's in our interests to ensure you have all the tools you need to grow individually.
