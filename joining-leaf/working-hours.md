# Working hours

We work seven and a half hour days at Leaf, but are comfortable with _when_ that's worked. For example, If you start at 9am, you're good to clock off at 5.30pm. Need to finish early? 8am - 4.30pm is fine too. The same applies for instances when you need to nip out during the working day; simply make up the time either side of the errand.  

The only thing we ask is that, if you're working directly with a client, that you map to their working hours as closely as possible, to allow for timely communications.
