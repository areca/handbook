# Dress code

One of the perks of being a remote company is that most of the time, you can wear whatever you like; no ironing, a single wardrobe, and at the end of the day, who doesn't like working in their pyjamas?

On days where you _are_ going to be client-facing, smart/casual is usually the way to go. Thankfully, these a few and far between, leaving you to wear whatever you please.
