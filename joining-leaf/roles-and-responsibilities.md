# Roles and responsibilities

We're not huge on complicated or overly presective job descriptions, but we'll ensure you have a good handle on the roles you're going to be asked to perform regularly.

Being such a small studio, there may be times you're asked to muck in with jobs that fall outside of this remit; we see this varience as a positive, allowing for fresh perspectives and new skills to be formed.
