# Job description

We're not huge on complicated or overly presective job descriptions, but you'll have a good handle on the roles you're likely be asked to perform with a degree of regularity.

Being such a small studio, there may be times you're asked to muck in with jobs that fall outside of this remind; we see this varience as a positive, allowing for fresh perspectives, and providing a platform for new skills to be formed.
