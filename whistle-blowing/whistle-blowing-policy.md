# Whistle-blowing policy

If you believe that the company is involved in any form of wrongdoing such as:
- committing a criminal offence;
- failing to comply with a legal obligation; endangering the health and safety of an individual;
- environmental damage; or
- concealing any information relating to the above

you should in the first instance report your concerns to a Director who will treat the matter with complete confidence. If you are not satisfied with the explanation or reason given to you, you should raise the matter with the appropriate organisation or body, e.g. the Police, the Environment Agency, Health and Safety Executive or Social Services Department.

If you do not report your concerns to a Director you may take them direct to the appropriate organisation or body.

The Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 prevents you from suffering a detriment or having your contract terminated for ‘whistle-blowing’ and we take very seriously any concerns which you may raise under this legislation.

We encourage you to use the procedure if you are concerned about any wrong doing at work. However, if the procedure has not been invoked in good faith (e.g. for malicious reasons or in pursuit of a personal grudge), then it will make you liable to immediate termination of engagement or such lesser disciplinary sanction as may be appropriate in the circumstances.
