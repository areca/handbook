# Inventions and discoveries

An invention or discovery made by you will normally belong to you. However, an invention or discovery made by you will become our property if it was made:
1. in the course of your normal duties under such circumstances that an invention might reasonably be expected to result from those duties;
2. outside the course of your normal duties, but during duties specifically assigned to you, when an invention might reasonably be expected to result from these; and
3. during the course of any of your duties, and at the time you had a special obligation to further our interests arising from the nature of those duties, and your particular responsibilities.
