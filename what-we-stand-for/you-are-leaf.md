# You are Leaf

When you join Leaf, you become part of our very fabric. The brand itself is simply a collection of individuals, and each and every one of that team represent us in everything they do.

When you come in contact with anyone outside of the organisation, you're Leaf. In each and every interaction you have with with a client, you are Leaf.

How we conduct ourselves, both digitally and in person, means everything in how we're perceived.
