# Our values
As a young studio, we're still finding our way as we go. However, we have a number of core values that guide us along the journey.

## Have fun
You're not working in a bank, and you should never feel like you are, Happy people produce better work, and we'll do everything we can to keep the environment fun. Not every moment of every day is going to be enjoyable, but you should be getting more out than you're leaving behind.

## Stay professional
Stay humble when things are going well, and remain level-headed when they're not. A Calm and rational approach to both positive and negative situations will ensure that you're well placed to handle whatever the day has to throw at you.

## Educate all
Every day is not only a chance to learn, but an opportunity to educate. Your role will allow you to not only work as part of a diverse team, but work with a number of very different clients; you'll likely have talents and insight that they don't, so where you can, leave them more knowledgeable than you found them.

## Keep it simple
The secret sauce to success is simplicity. The ability to communicate clearly is essential when working with clients, and its importance is amplified further by being a remote studio. From a technical perspective, complex solutions are good; simple solutions are better.

## Push yourself
At Leaf, we look for individuals who have a clear desire to improve themselves. Different organisations look for different skills, and we absolutely have a soft spot for good old fashioned drive. Being part of a small team ensures there's always opportunity to just head-first in to something new.

## Work to live
Your role at Leaf is of course important, and we hope you're as proud of being part of the team as we are, but art the end of the day, it's just a job. No matter what, nothing is ever more important than living your life; make time for family, friends, exploration, exercise, and relaxation.
