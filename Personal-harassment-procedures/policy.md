# Policy

1. We deplore all forms of personal harassment and seek to ensure that the working environment is sympathetic to all our employees.
2. We have published these procedures to inform employees of the type of behaviour that is unacceptable and provide employees who are the victims of personal harassment with a means of redress.
3. We recognise that we have a duty to implement this policy and all employees are expected to comply with it.
