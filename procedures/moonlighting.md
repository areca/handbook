# Moonlighting

Secondary employment, or 'moonlighting', is the act of taking on additional work, paid or otherwise, outside of Leaf. Anything you decide to do in your own time shouldn't have a negative impact of your performance or dedication to you role here, nor should it create a conflicts of interest.

While it'd be impossible to set a blanket ruling on the matter, we've got a set of guidelines that help outline what's cool and what's not.

We've got no objections to taking on occasional pieces of work on the side; freelancing or pro-bono work is great for sharpening your skills, and we want to support that. Alternatively, a few hours a week on a business not in conflict with Leaf shouldn't cause any problems.

Working for anything that requires your attention during standard working hours, or takes up a disproportionate amount of your time, isn't going to allow to give your all for Leaf. Working in any capacity for another company where there may be a conflict of interest wouldn't be something we'd entertain.

If you're unsure about something you want to do outside of Leaf, Mike or Chris will always be happy to discuss the matter. Ultimately, want to support our team in exploring areas they wish to, but where we see a impact performance here at Leaf, or potential conflicts, we've got to put the company first.
