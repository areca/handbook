# Parental leave

If you are entitled to take parental leave in respect of the current statutory provisions, you should discuss your needs with Chris or Mike, who will identify your entitlements and look at the proposed leave periods dependent upon your child’s/children’s particular circumstances and the operational aspects of the business.
