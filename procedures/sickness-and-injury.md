# Sickness and injury

We all suffer ill health from time-to-time, and it's entirely expected that there will be occasions in which you're unable to do your job.

## Notifying us
As soon as you're aware that you'll be unable to work, let Mike or Chris know either through Slack, email, or by phone.

## Short term absence
Like it or not, resting up is often the best bet. If you're unable to work for anything up to 5 working days, we'll

## Long term absence
If your incapacity extends to more than seven calendar days, it's important you keep us informed of your progress once a week thereafter.

If you're absent for four or more consecutive days because of sickness or injury, and provided you meet the statutory qualifying conditions, you'll be entitled to statutory sick pay (SSP). SSP is treated like wages and is subject to normal deductions.

Qualifying days are the only days for which you are entitled to SSP. These days are normally your working days unless otherwise notified to you. The first three qualifying days of absence are waiting days for which SSP is not payable. Where a second or subsequent period of incapacity (of four days or more) occurs within 56 days of a previous period of incapacity, waiting days are not served again.

Any contractual sickness/injury payments are shown in your individual Statement of Main Terms of Employment.

Any days of contractual sickness/injury payments which qualify for SSP will be offset against SSP on a day-to-day basis. A deduction will be made for any other state benefits received if you are excluded or transferred from SSP.

If you are entitled to any payments in excess of SSP and your entitlement expires, full or part payment may be allowed at our discretion where it is considered that there are special circumstances warranting it.

Where the circumstances of your incapacity are such that you receive or are awarded any sum by way of compensation or damages in respect of the incapacity from a third party, then any payments which we may have made to you because of the absence (including SSP) shall be repaid by you to us up to an amount not exceeding the amount of the compensation or damages paid by the third party and up to, but not exceeding, any amount paid by us.

## While you're off
The only thing we ask is that, while you're off work, try and do everything you can to aid the recovery process. Don't push yourself, try and work (for Leaf or anyone else), and above all us get some rest.
