# Car insurance

If you are using your own car for business purposes, you must ensure that your car insurance provides adequate cover. Proof of adequate insurance, Driving Licence, Tax and an MOT Certificate must be produced for scrutiny by the Organisation, upon renewal and at any time when so requested.
